# Motivation 
The violent crime rate in U.S increased by 3.4 percent nationwide in 2016 in US. As an international student, as well as a New Yorker, the public safety in NYC is always a concern to us, especially after the recent terrorists attack near the World Trade Center. Thus, our group decided to make a deeper investigation of the crime data and seek out some underlying reasons which led to the increase of crime rate.

# Related work
The New York City Police Department provides overall crime dataset. NYPD also established a CompStat model, called [CompStat 2.0](https://compstat.nypdonline.org/2e5c3f4b-85c1-4635-83c6-22b27fe7c75c/view/89), providing greater specificity about crimes through an online interactive experience.

On the official website of new york city, there is also a [Crime Map](https://maps.nyc.gov/crime/) which enables people to view crime by precinct. This map includes crimes of seven major felonies.

# Data Description
NYPD official [website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/historical.page) provides citywide histroic crime data in forms of excel. We downloaded these datasets and merged them into the nyc_crime_hist. The resulting data frame contain information about the total number of offenses from 2000 to 2016 and major offense categories(felony, misdemeanor, and violation) and detailed descriptions.

# Summary
Our analysis in focusing on providing information about crimes in NYC. The map helps to visualize where crimes occured in nyc. The trend of crimes shows the change over years and months. It also demonstrates that crimes are more likely to happen during afternoon and evening instead of mid night and early morning. Looking at different boros, we analyzed the common crimes in each boro. Bronx relatively has more crimes while Queens relatively is safest boro in NYC. Among all the criminal type, misdemeanor is the most frequently one. 

The information about crimes aroused our interest to ask what causes the difference in crime frequency. We collect the data about income and unemployment and analyze their association with crime rate. Since we only have 5 boros in nyc, there are not clear and strong evidence to show a significant relation.
